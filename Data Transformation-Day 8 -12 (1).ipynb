    "In label encoding, categorical data is converted to numerical data, and the values are assigned labels (such as 1, 2, and 3). Predictive models that use this numerical data for analysis might sometimes mistake these labels for some kind of order (for example, a model might think that a label of 3 is \"better\" than a label of 1, which is incorrect). In order to avoid this confusion, we can use one-hot encoding. Here, the label-encoded data is further divided into n number of columns. Here, n denotes the total number of unique labels generated while performing label encoding. For example, say that three new labels are generated through label encoding. Then, while performing one-hot encoding, the columns will be divided into three parts. So, the value of n is 3. Let's look at an exercise to get further clarification."
